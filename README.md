# degoutils

This repository contains various utilities which I use in my other Go packages.

The code in this repository varies between stuff I use commonly to experimental
stuff that has never been used. Things may change without warning.

Persons other than me shouldn't import anything in this repository; everything
in it is unstable, and I may make breaking changes at any time. If I change
something in a breaking way in this repository, I'll update all of my projects
that rely on it, but that can't be said of anyone else importing this code.

If you want to import anything in this repository, maybe let me know and I'll
consider making a separate repository for it.
